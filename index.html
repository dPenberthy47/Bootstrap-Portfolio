I've been learning the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a couple of months, and I find it fascinating. Outside of coding, I take my relationship with Jesus and very seriously. I am also an avid supporter of Liverpool FC who loves coffee and craft beer.</p>
                            <p class="second-row">I am heavily interested in blockchain technology for its potential prospects in the business world. However, in this boot camp I want to start by learning how to make complete, useful apps.</p>
                            <p class="second-row">My favorite part of coding is how it allows me to solve problems technically yet creatively. I consider myself to be a logicly drivin person with a creative mind. Such a combination has bode well for me in my coding career thus far. As I continue to improve as a coder, I know that I will only becomne better at serving people by solving their problems.</p>
